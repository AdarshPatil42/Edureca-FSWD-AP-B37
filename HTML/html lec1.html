        <h2>HTML</h2>
        The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents 
        designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as 
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
        
        <br/><br/>

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render
        the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page 
        semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
